# Real-Time Hand Sign Detection and Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on real-time hand sign detection and recognition using computer vision techniques. The system accurately identifies left or right hand signs and dynamically updates the displayed signs.

## Features

- *Real-Time Detection:* Utilizes computer vision with MediaPipe for precise hand tracking and dynamic sign recognition.
- *Python Libraries:* Implements OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sign recognition.
- *Dynamic Visualization:* Provides live updates of detected hand signs with a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- *Python Libraries:* OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow
- *Web Framework:* Flask (for optional web-based deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
